    <p>
       We are a team of software engineers with expertise in DevOps, system architecture,
       scalability, software delivery, security, Amazon Web Services, and more. Our mission
       is to make it an order of magnitude easier to understand, develop, and deploy software.
       In just a couple weeks, we can get you up and running on AWS with DevOps best practices
       and world-class infrastructure. We take care of all the "undifferentiated heavy
       lifting"—the grunt work—so that your team can focus on the products and services unique
       to your company.

    <p>
      Gruntwork originally started out as two companies, Atomic Squirrel, founded by Jim, and Phoenix DevOps,
      founded by Josh. Jim and Josh met in 2015, realized they were working towards the same vision, and began working together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2016, after working with a number of clients and building up a library of reusable scripts, templates, and best practices,
      they merged the two companies together into Gruntwork.
